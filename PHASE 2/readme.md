# Project Title: Starbucks Assist
This project is an online ordering system wherein customer's can have a convenient time to pick-up their order. They no longer need to wait for their drink as they can use the system to order it ahead. In the system, customers will need an account first before being able to order any drinks. The customers will also be able to see the new products that are released in Starbucks and also the Barista's recommendation. This project aims to give customers a sense of ease in picking up their order as it will be ready once they pick it up.
